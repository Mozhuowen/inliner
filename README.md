# inliner

A Python script to convert reference-style Markdown endnotes to Pandoc's inline footnotes ("this is some text^[this is a footnote]"). Works on documents with 99,999 or fewer notes; if that's not enough for you, you've got bigger problems than footnote formatting.

*Usage*: python inliner.py [input.md] [output.md]
